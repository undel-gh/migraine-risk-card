# Migraine Risk Card for Home Assistant

A science-backed environmental migraine risk monitoring card for Home Assistant. It tracks up to 9 weather and air-quality factors known to trigger migraines and shows a composite risk score on a visual gauge — plus tomorrow's outlook.

## Why I Built This

I'm a chronic migraine sufferer, and over the years I've learned that my migraines don't just appear out of nowhere — they follow the weather. A pressure drop before a storm front, a sudden temperature swing, poor air-quality days — these are the invisible triggers that can send me reaching for medication hours later.

Knowing this changed everything for me. If I can see the environmental warning signs *before* symptoms hit, I can take my preemptive medication early and actually get ahead of an attack instead of chasing it. So I built a system in Home Assistant that watches the weather for me and tells me when conditions are stacking up.

I shared a few screenshots of my dashboard with friends, and then they shared them, and before long people were asking how they could set it up for themselves. So here it is — the same system I rely on every day, packaged up for anyone who wants to take back a little control from their migraines.

I hope it helps you as much as it's helped me.

## What's New in 3.0

**The card is now self-sufficient — the sensor package is optional.** Point any factor at a `weather.*` entity and the card does the rest itself:

- **Pressure and temperature trends** are computed in-card from Home Assistant's own recorder history — no helper sensors, no automations. Point a pressure factor at your barometer *or* a weather entity and it works out the change over 6h/24h for you.
- **Storms and tomorrow's forecast** come from the live forecast feed (`weather/subscribe_forecast`) — the same mechanism the built-in weather card uses.
- **Reads weather-entity attributes directly** — temperature, humidity, wind, UV and pressure are pulled from the entity's attributes, so a single `weather.*` entity can feed most of the card.
- **Unit-aware** — mixes sources freely and normalises them (°F→°C, mmHg/inHg→hPa, m/s / mph / kn→km/h) for scoring while showing each value in its own units.
- **Translations** — English and Russian, auto-selected from your Home Assistant language, with a manual override in the editor.

The result: everything updates through HACS with one click. The sensor package is still worth installing if you want **server-side scoring, notifications/automations, or the bundled WAQI air-quality sensors** — see [Optional: the sensor package](#optional-the-sensor-package).

## Features

- **Up to 9 environmental factors** — barometric pressure change (6h & 24h), humidity, temperature extremes, rapid temperature change, wind speed, UV index, thunderstorm proximity, and air quality (AQI)
- **Composite risk score** on a 0–22 scale with four levels (Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
- **Tomorrow's forecast** — next-day risk computed from your weather entity's forecast
- **Works with any weather integration** — Met.no, OpenWeatherMap, Gismeteo, Yandex, BOM, or any provider that creates a `weather.*` entity
- **Optional air quality** — connect a WAQI/OpenAQ/any AQI sensor for the pollution factor
- **Show only what you configure** — unconfigured factors simply don't appear, and the gauge maximum adjusts to match
- **English & Russian UI**, auto-detected
- **Dark-theme design** with colour-coded tiles and a semicircular gauge

## Installation

### Step 1 — Install the card via HACS

1. Open **HACS** in the sidebar.
2. Three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
3. Repository: `https://github.com/undel-gh/migraine-risk-card`, category **Dashboard**.
4. **Add**, then find **Migraine Risk Card** and click **Download**.

> Modern HACS registers the dashboard resource for you — you do **not** need to add a resource manually under *Settings → Dashboards → Resources*. Adding one by hand creates a **second, un-cache-busted copy** of the card, which loads an old version alongside the new one. If your card ever looks out of date or the language selector vanishes, check for a duplicate resource — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

After downloading, hard-refresh your browser (**Ctrl+F5**). Open the browser console (F12) and you should see a single banner: `🧠 Migraine Risk Card v3.1.0`.

### Step 2 — Add the card to a dashboard

**Through the UI (easiest):**
1. Edit your dashboard (pencil icon) → **+ Add Card**.
2. In the **Custom** section, pick **Migraine Risk Card**.
3. Fill in the entity mappings in the editor and **Save**.

**YAML — self-sufficient setup (recommended):** one weather entity feeds most factors; add a barometer and an AQI sensor if you have them.

```yaml
type: custom:migraine-risk-card
entity_pressure_6h: weather.home        # or a dedicated barometer sensor
entity_pressure_24h: weather.home       # (the card computes the change from history)
entity_humidity: weather.home
entity_temperature: weather.home
entity_temperature_change: weather.home # computed from 6h of recorder history
entity_wind_speed: weather.home
entity_uv_index: weather.home
entity_storm: weather.home              # thunderstorm from the live forecast
entity_forecast: weather.home           # tomorrow's risk from the forecast
entity_air_quality: sensor.waqi_home    # optional — omit to hide the tile
```

Every factor is optional. Omit a line and that tile disappears and the gauge maximum drops accordingly.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `entity_pressure_6h` | entity | Pressure change over 6h. Give it a barometer or a weather entity; absolute pressure is auto-detected and the change is derived from history. |
| `entity_pressure_24h` | entity | Pressure change over 24h (as above). |
| `entity_humidity` | entity | Relative humidity (sensor, or `humidity` attribute of a weather entity). |
| `entity_temperature` | entity | Current temperature. |
| `entity_temperature_change` | entity | 6h temperature change. A weather entity or absolute-temperature sensor is fine — the change is computed from history. |
| `entity_wind_speed` | entity | Wind speed (any unit; normalised to km/h for scoring). |
| `entity_uv_index` | entity | UV index. |
| `entity_storm` | entity | Thunderstorm factor. A weather entity uses the live forecast; a sensor is read directly. |
| `entity_air_quality` | entity | AQI sensor (e.g. WAQI). Omit to hide the factor. |
| `entity_forecast` | entity | Tomorrow's outlook. A `weather.*` entity is computed in-card; a `sensor.migraine_risk_forecast_tomorrow` from the package is read directly. |
| `entity_risk_score` | entity | *Integration mode only.* A pre-computed score sensor from the package. **Leave empty for standalone mode** — otherwise the card shows this value instead of its own calculation. |
| `entity_risk_level` | entity | *Integration mode only.* Pre-computed risk level from the package. |
| `displayUnits` | `metric` \| `imperial` | Display units only; scoring is always metric. Default `metric`. |
| `language` | `auto` \| `en` \| `ru` | UI language. Default `auto` (from Home Assistant). |
| `max_score` | number | Override the gauge maximum (integration mode). Leave empty for automatic. |
| `thresholds` | object | Personal trigger thresholds — see [Calibration](#calibrating-to-your-personal-triggers). |

> **Standalone vs integration mode:** if `entity_risk_score` is set, the card trusts that sensor and ignores its own per-factor scoring. For the self-sufficient setup above, **leave `entity_risk_score` and `entity_risk_level` empty** so the gauge reflects the tiles you configured.

## Data-source notes

A few things worth knowing when choosing what to feed each factor:

- **Pressure — a physical barometer wins.** It reports every minute versus a weather provider's 30–60 min, so a falling front shows up hours earlier. Pressure is spatially smooth and a barometer can live indoors, so it's immune to sun/radiation error. The card reads absolute pressure and derives the change from history — no calibration needed.
- **Temperature & humidity — trust a good local sensor, but beware radiation error.** A poorly-shielded outdoor sensor that over-reads in morning sun will inflate the temperature factors *and* depress humidity at the same time. Until shielding is sorted, a weather integration is often the safer source. Pick one humidity source and stick with it — providers can disagree by 10%+.
- **AQI is not in weather entities.** The Home Assistant `weather` domain has no air-quality field — no provider exposes it there. Use a dedicated integration (WAQI, AirVisual, OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution) and point `entity_air_quality` at its sensor. If the nearest monitoring station is far away, consider leaving the factor off rather than scoring someone else's air.
- **Recorder must be on for the pressure/temperature-change factors.** The card reads history from the recorder, so the chosen entity must not be excluded from recording. If a change factor shows `…` forever, check your `recorder:` `exclude:` config.

## Optional: the sensor package

The bundled `sensor-package/migraine_sensors.yaml` reproduces the scoring **server-side** and adds things the card can't do on its own: notifications and automations, history you can graph, and WAQI air-quality sensors (AQI/PM2.5/PM10/ozone). It's entirely optional in 3.0.

1. Enable packages in `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   homeassistant:
     packages: !include_dir_named packages
   ```
2. Download the **latest** `migraine_sensors.yaml` and save it to `/config/packages/`:
   - [migraine_sensors.yaml on main](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/undel-gh/migraine-risk-card/main/sensor-package/migraine_sensors.yaml) (right-click → Save As), or from the [latest release](https://github.com/undel-gh/migraine-risk-card/releases/latest) → Assets.
   > **Always re-download; don't reuse an old local copy** — older versions had scoring bugs.
3. **Restart Home Assistant** (not just *Reload Template Entities* — the package registers trigger-based sensors and helpers).
4. Set your sources under **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers** — the `Migraine Source: …` helpers. At minimum set **Weather Entity**; leave any you don't have blank.
5. Point the card at the package's sensors if you want the gauge to match the server-side score exactly:
   ```yaml
   entity_risk_score: sensor.migraine_risk_score
   entity_risk_level: sensor.migraine_risk_level
   entity_forecast: sensor.migraine_risk_forecast_tomorrow
   ```

The package fetches forecasts with the modern `weather.get_forecasts` action (weather entities no longer expose a `forecast` attribute) and detects thunderstorms from both the forecast and warning/forecast text — English and Russian keywords are recognised.

## Calibrating to Your Personal Triggers

The default thresholds are research-based averages, but migraine triggers are highly individual — one person reacts to a 4 hPa pressure drop, another only past 10. Since v3.1 every scoring threshold can be tuned to your own history, no YAML editing required.

**With the sensor package installed (easiest):** go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers** and search "Migraine Threshold". You'll find 20 sliders — the point steps for every factor (e.g. *Pressure 6h → 1 pt*, default 4 hPa). Change a value and both the server-side scoring **and the card** pick it up immediately: the card reads the same helpers automatically, so one calibration applies everywhere.

**Without the package:** create `input_number` helpers with the well-known IDs (`input_number.migraine_threshold_pressure_6h_1` … see the table below), or set thresholds directly in the card config:

```yaml
type: custom:migraine-risk-card
# ...
thresholds:
  pressure_6h: [3, 5, 7, 9]   # point ladder: ≥3 → 1pt, ≥5 → 2 … 
  humidity_low: 25             # dry-air trigger
  uv: [5, 7]
```

Card config takes precedence over helpers; helpers take precedence over defaults. Available keys and their defaults:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pressure_6h` | `[4, 6, 8, 10]` | hPa drop over 6h → 1/2/3/4 pts |
| `pressure_24h` | `[6, 10, 14]` | hPa drop over 24h → 1/2/3 pts |
| `humidity_low` | `30` | below this % → 1 pt (dry air) |
| `humidity_high` | `80` | above this % → 2 pts |
| `temp_hot` | `30` | above this °C → 2 pts |
| `temp_cold` | `5` | below this °C → 2 pts |
| `temp_change` | `[5, 8]` | °C change over 6h → 1/2 pts |
| `wind` | `[35, 50]` | km/h → 1/2 pts |
| `uv` | `[6, 8]` | UV index → 1/2 pts |
| `aqi` | `[50, 100, 150]` | AQI above step → 1/2/3 pts |

Matching helper IDs: array keys get `_1`, `_2`, … suffixes (`migraine_threshold_uv_1`), scalar keys use the name as-is (`migraine_threshold_humidity_low`).

**How to calibrate:** when a migraine hits, note the card's factor tiles (or the `sensor.migraine_risk_score` attributes). If attacks reliably arrive at pressure drops the card scores 0–1, lower the pressure steps; if UV never seems to matter for you, raise the UV steps so the factor stays quiet. Adjust one factor at a time and give each change a couple of weeks of history before the next tweak.

## How the Scoring Works

Nine factors, each scored on a 0–2 or 0–4 scale:

| Factor | Max | Thresholds |
|---|---|---|
| Pressure change (6h) | 4 | ≥4 hPa: 1 · ≥6: 2 · ≥8: 3 · ≥10: 4 |
| Pressure change (24h) | 3 | ≥6 hPa: 1 · ≥10: 2 · ≥14: 3 |
| Humidity | 2 | <30%: 1 · >80%: 2 |
| Temperature extreme | 2 | >30 °C or <5 °C: 2 |
| Temperature change (6h) | 2 | ≥5 °C: 1 · ≥8 °C: 2 |
| Wind speed | 2 | ≥35 km/h: 1 · ≥50 km/h: 2 |
| UV index | 2 | ≥6: 1 · ≥8: 2 |
| Thunderstorm | 2 | Forecast: 1 · Active/within 3h: 2 |
| Air quality (AQI) | 3 | 51–100: 1 · 101–150: 2 · 151+: 3 |
| **Total** | **22** | |

**Risk levels:** Low (0–3) · Moderate (4–7) · High (8–11) · Very High (12+). The gauge maximum reflects only the factors you actually configure. All thresholds above are the defaults — see [Calibrating to Your Personal Triggers](#calibrating-to-your-personal-triggers).

## Troubleshooting

**Card looks out of date — old language/values, `…°C` says "cloudy", pressure reads ~980 as a "change".** These are the fingerprints of an **older version loading alongside the new one**. Open the console (F12): if you see **two** `Migraine Risk Card` banners, you have a duplicate resource.
- Go to **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources** (enable *Advanced Mode* in your profile if the menu is hidden).
- Keep the HACS-managed entry — its URL ends in `?hacstag=…` (the tag busts the cache on every update). **Delete** any duplicate `migraine-risk-card.js` **without** a `hacstag`, and remove any stray `/config/www/…migraine…` file that isn't under `www/community/migraine-risk-card/`.
- **Ctrl+F5.** You should now see a single banner.

**A pressure/temperature-change tile shows `…` and never resolves.** The source entity is excluded from the recorder. Remove it from `recorder:` `exclude:`, or give the factor a sensor that is recorded.

**AQI shows `0 AQI`.** No air-quality source is configured. Add a WAQI (or similar) integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** (it needs an aqicn.org token, added through the UI — the old YAML `waqi:` platform was removed), then set `entity_air_quality`. Or omit the option to hide the tile.

**A factor shows `?`.** The configured entity ID doesn't exist — check for a typo or a renamed entity.

## Scientific Background

Several environmental factors are associated with migraine onset:

- **Barometric pressure drops** are the most-studied trigger; a 5–10 hPa fall over 6–24 h correlates with increased frequency (Kimoto et al., 2011; Okuma et al., 2015).
- **High humidity** and **temperature extremes** are linked to onset (Hoffmann et al., 2015).
- **Rapid temperature change** can drive vasodilation/constriction cycles.
- **Thunderstorms** bring sharp pressure changes and increased sferics.
- **Poor air quality** (PM2.5, ozone) correlates with higher headache prevalence (Szyszkowicz et al., 2009).

The card aggregates these into a single actionable score so you can act before symptoms start.

## Development

The card source is [`src/migraine-risk-card.js`](src/migraine-risk-card.js); [`dist/`](dist/) is the shipped copy (no bundler — a straight copy of `src/`). To release: edit `src/`, bump `CARD_VERSION`, copy to `dist/`, commit, and tag. CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs HACS validation and checks that `dist/` matches `src/`; `release.yml` attaches the card and sensor package to each published release.

> Keep `CARD_VERSION` in step with the release tag — the console banner and the HACS version should agree.
